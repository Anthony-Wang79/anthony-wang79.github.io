- [The Impact of Public-Private Partnership Health Plans on Private Insurance](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5250649). with [Hui Ding](https://dh-huiding.github.io/), and [Xian Xu](http://xianxu-econ.com/). <span style="color:gray">Revise and Resubmit at *Journal of Development Economics*.</span>
>  Abstract: Public-private partnership (PPP) health insurance has been seen as a promising tool to expand coverage while maintaining fiscal sustainability, but its impact remains unclear, particularly whether it increases overall coverage or displaces private insurance. Using the rollout of China’s City-Customized Supplemental Medical Insurance (CCSMI) and private insurance purchase data, we find that CCSMI significantly crowds out private insurance at both extensive (enrollment) and intensive (coverage level) margins. Premiums also decline conditional on the plans chosen. The drop in private insurance offsets at least 25% of CCSMI enrollment gains, underscoring the need for careful evaluation and design of PPP insurance.
